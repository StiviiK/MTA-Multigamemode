<h2>Open MTA:DayZ</h2>
Open MTA:DayZ is a gamemode for Multi Theft Auto : San Andreas, aiming to recreate the popular ArmA II Mod DayZ in MTA.

<h3>Download</h3>
As we're currently still developing the gamemode there's no public download available. However we encourage you to check out our source code from the repository. Please note that the current state of the gamemode is neither final nor stable, but highly in-progress and (partially) experimental.

<h3>Help</h3>
If you need any assistance, or want to ask any questions you can get into contact with the developers via IRC in the GTANet IRC Network (irc.gtanet.com) in the #open_dayz channel.

<h3>Contributing</h3>
Due to the open source nature of the project, everyone is welcome to fork and submit pull requests. After reviewing the changes and ensuring code quality we'll decide whether to apply your patch to the main codebase. After a few good patches you'll be granted push/commit access allowing you to directly push your changes to the repository.

We also providing an addon interface, allowing other users to contribute their extensions to the main gamemode independendly from others. These addons have access to large parts of the gamemode via a simple API layer.

<h3>MTA:SA</h3>
We're relying on the Lua scripting interface of the Multi Theft Auto : San Andreas mod, if you haven't played it you can download it from http://mtasa.com!
